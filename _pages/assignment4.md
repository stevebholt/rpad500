## Overview of Group Assignments
The group assignments in this class serve two important functions. First, they will provide groups with a role in a scenario that facilitates the application of concepts from the modules to a more concrete example. The assignments will generally take place in a fictional city, [Hopetopia](https://stevebholt.github.io/hopetopia/), which is loosely based on real cities and the parameters and characteristics of which will be provided as relevant to each activity. Second, many of the skills targeted by the assignments are trial runs for working with concepts that will be explored in more depth in essays 1 and 2 later in the course. Generally, applications grounded in a hypothetical situation similar to real-world events provides opportunities for more enjoyable and interesting discussion. It also provides an early, low-stakes context to get to know your group mates and their work styles. All group assignments should be grounded in the city of Hopetopia using the information on its website (linked above) as well as research on any proposed programs/policies.

**Tip:** In many group assignments, you will be asked to write a 1- or 2-page memo to respond to the prompt. Building a good memo packs a lot of information succinctly into a short document. Use the data and information about Hopetopia to creatively build your case in the memo alongside in-depth research about related problems and evidence for the solution you are proposing (see the acceptable sources section [on the syllabus](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad500/syllabus/#two-essays) for some source ideas.

## Group Assignment 4

For assignment 4, we continue our management of Hopetopia. All 10 groups will be representing different Hopetopia city government agencies. The city received a grant to offset some operating funds and has a little budgetary room now. The mayor’s office has decided to give each agency a lump sum of money to develop new programming to support their missions. Each agency will receive $750,000 additional dollars from the mayor’s office. Each group will prepare a 1-2 page memo that outlines: 1) what their new program will do and why it’s important (it can be modeled after a real existing program you find compelling in another city – just be sure to note the city and explain the program well); 2) the new positions that will be created to support the program (with salaries); 3) the roles and responsibilities for each position; 4) what skills and qualifications each position will need and why; and 5) the length of time to fill the position and process for filling it (what will the agency do to attract applications, how many candidates will be interviewed, what will be the steps taken to review qualifications and decide). As with previous assignments, you will be writing a 1-2 page memo as a group and posting it in the Hopetopia Forum as a reply to the “Assignment 4 Thread” I have created. Be sure your post includes the names of all group members.

## Mayor's Budget Memo
To: City Government Department Heads
From: The Mayor’s Office (Brandon Bernard, Korra Johnson, Ebony Liriano, & Sarah Lusardi)
Subject: Budget Changes Memo
Date: September 21, 2022

Summary - The decision for our FY22 budget is to allocate the 5% budget surplus between our five city departments to align with our missions of increasing housing affordability and stimulating the business economy in the Southwest Ward (“SW”).  We recommend the following allocations to each department to aid in their roles in achieving our mission: 

- Dept. of Emergency Services: +1.95% ($ 1,253,314,600 total) toward police-community relations, professional development, investigations, and fire inspection efforts
- Dept. of Community Development: +49.45% ($ 217,221,800 total) 
- Dept. of Social Services: +8.55% ($ 608,625,200 total)
- Dept. of General Services: +4.91% ($ 921,799,280 total) 
- Dept. of Education: +2.67% ($ 2,030,549,120 total) 

See [Appendix A](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad500/assets/documents/budget_group1.pdf) for a more detailed view of allocation breakdowns.

I. Primary Focus to continue investing in our SW’s affordable housing. Community development is our strongest focus. The Mayor aims to keep the promises of his platform by increasing affordable, safely constructed, and well-maintained housing to those citizens in most need of it. 

II. Investment in public roads to improve employer attractability in the SW Ward. Increased funding to the Transportation Department will invest in the SW Ward’s crumbling infrastructure. Attracting businesses will stimulate economic growth and connect employers to employees across the city. Increased access to resources is a secondary benefit for citizens, with half the major grocers leaving the SW Ward, connecting our citizens to necessary resources is a top concern.  

III. Investment in our social services will reduce crime and, in turn, attract more businesses. Studies show that mental health, crime, and social needs, i.e. unemployment and homelessness, are interconnected (Reducing Crime, 2018). To reduce these issues, greater attention should be placed on mental health services (Reducing Crime, 2018). The improvement in these areas will attract more business owners to the SW Ward.

IV. Continuing to invest strongly in education (the heart of our city). Our fourth focus is to invest more in education in the SW Ward to increase economic equity and alleviate overcrowding in schools in SW and NE Wards. All benefit from continued investment in experienced teachers to improve school ratings to attract homeowners and businesses. In tandem with this focus is the goal to strengthen fiscal and professional accountability. 

Conclusion - We ask that you present your proposed allocation of budgetary funds and three potential stakeholders to the Mayor’s Office by Sept. 21st, 2022, to best serve our areas of focus for Hopetopia’s citizens in the coming year.
