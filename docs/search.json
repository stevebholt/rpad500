    "text": "üë®‚Äçüè´: Stephen Holt, Ph.D.\nüìÖ: Asynchronous Online\nüìß: sbholt@albany.edu\nüè´: Wednesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm or by appointment - book here; in-person in Milne 324 or online in GatherTown.1\n‚òéÔ∏è: 518-442-3309\n\n\n\nThis course is designed to provide students an introduction to the field of public administration, including its practice, themes and values, and contemporary challenges. Public administration is government in action, as broadly defined by Woodrow Wilson in 1887. Public administration includes activities taken directly by government, or indirectly by its partners, to meet the democratically expressed needs of the public. These activities include policy design, implementation, evaluation of outcomes, and re-design or re-direction.\nBy the end of this course, students should be able to 1) critically analyze administrative problems and evaluate potential solutions; 2) consider questions of accountability and responsiveness in administrative action; and 3) analyze the potential challenges in implementing public programs through both public and private organizations. Students should leave class with a deep understanding of both the technical challenges and competing values present in implementing and managing public programs.2\n\n\n\nRecognizing Public Value by Mark H. Moore\nAdditional readings will be made available on Zotero in the class library.\n\n\n\nZotero - Zotero is a free platform for organizing and sharing academic work and it is how readings will be distributed to the class. You can download the app here. I suggest also downloading the browser connector for whatever browser you use - it helps save a dramatic amount of time when conducting a literature review. During the first week of classes you will receive an invitation to join the class Zotero library. If you do not receive one, please email the professor. I provide an introduction to Zotero and the features most applicable to this class in the embedded video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are a variety of citation organizer software options out there for researchers to use and, having experimented with most of them, Zotero is by far the best. It is free; Open Source; designed and developed by researchers; and governed as a non-profit to protect the integrity and accessibility of the software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip on Zotero\n\n\n\nWhen you receive an announcement that the group invitations for the class library have been sent, go to the Zotero.org website, login to your account, and click the groups tab. You should see RPAD 500 with a red button that says join. Click join. In the Zotero app, click the green refresh circle in the top right and the class library should appear.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding American Politics and Government by J.J. Coleman, K.M. Goldstein, and W.G. Howell is a good resource for getting a basic primer on American Government. There will be a very basic primer in the course, but some students may need a bit more and this book is a good place to start.\nNew York State Government by R.B. Ward is an excellent (if a little dated) overview of New York State government.\n\n\n\n\nSince the class is an asynchronous class and not inherently structured by class time, I find it helpful to describe a typical week a student can expect from the course. The course is structured so that students use Brightspace to 1) watch lectures, 2) receive and turn in assignments, 3) interact, and 4) ask general questions for me. A typical week will involve:\n\nMondays a new module will open and it will include i) an overview of the week‚Äôs topics, ii) list of assigned reading, and iii) list of assignments.\nFridays the group assignment will be due for the week. I will then provide feedback on group assignments with a video in the following week‚Äôs module.\nSundays the weekly readings quiz will be due on Brightspace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Note on Groups\n\n\n\nIn this class you tackle broader research projects on teams. This is by design because most professional work is conducted on teams, most decisions in public work are made by consensus, and opportunities to learn to adjust to different working styles while managing projects helps develop important and transferable skills. I strongly encourage you to meet with your groups with an early video call and get to know each other, your schedules, and so on. Communication helps dramatically in successful groups. That said, some group dynamics can - in very rare circumstances - become bad for all involved. I provide two means for coping: first, students can use peer evaluations to ensure accountability in group work. And second, if that is insufficient, the group can vote to remove a member and inform me of the decision. No harm, no foul. This should be considered a measure of last resort and only pursued if a group member has made no contributions to the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following assignments will form the basis of your grade in this course:\n\nTwo essays (70% of final grade)\nWeekly quizzes (15% of final grade)\nGroup assignments (10% of final grade)\nParticipation (5% of final grade)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll assignments will be turned in via Brightspace.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo assess your understanding of the course material and your ability to apply concepts to real life cases of government action, students will write three essays during the semester. The essays will require students to conduct independent research and analysis. Additional details about the exact questions and formatting will be distributed separately. Together, the essays constitute 70% of the student‚Äôs grade for the course. The essays will be graded using the rubric outlined in the Appendix. Each essay will be weighted equally, and the average grade across both essays will determine your grade for the essay portion of your final grade. For instance, if your average grade across both essays is an 89, you will receive an 89 for the essay portion of your final grade.\nPre-writing tasks. To improve the quality of the essays, you may submit for feedback a one page summary of the major arguments of your essay one week before each essay is due. I will not accept late submissions of summaries. I will return the summaries 2 to 3 days after submission.\nAcceptable sources. Generally, your research should use primary sources more than secondary sources. Primary sources include, but are not limited to: government reports, legislative hearings and testimonies, court decisions, and government auditor reports. Secondary sources are summaries and interpretations of primary sources. Secondary sources include, but are not limited to, articles from major newspapers and news magazines, network and cable news programs, and academic research. Blogs and Wikipedia are not acceptable sources. Be an intelligent consumer of information by evaluating secondary sources for potential political bias. If it is well known that a particular source is liberal or conservative, you must compensate for this in the paper. Acknowledge its bias and balance the information with something from a source on the other side of the political spectrum. Here are some places to start with your research, but feel free to consult other sources:\n\nAcademic research published in public administration, political science, economics, or policy journals such as: Public Administration Review, Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, American Review of Public Administration, Administration and Society, Journal of Public Policy Analysis and Management, American Political Science Review, American Journal of Political Science, and Journal of Politics, American Economic Review, Journal of Labor Economics, Policy Studies Journal.\nCongressional testimony (available through Lexis/Nexis via the library) and reports completed by Congressional committee staff\nAgency Inspector General reports\nCongressional Research Service reports\nU.S. Government Accountability Office reports\nThe library also has research support services for this class, which can be found here\n\nSubmission of papers. Each final essay is due by midnight on the designated due date. Electronic versions of the paper are to be submitted via the SafeAssign link in Blackboard. It is the student‚Äôs responsibility to ensure the electronic file is readable and not corrupted. Please note: once you hit the submit button in SafeAssign, you cannot go back and submit a different version.\nLate assignments. An assignment is considered late if the paper copy is not submitted at the beginning of class, if the electronic file is not submitted before class, and/or if the electronic file is not readable. Assignments (electronic or hard copy) submitted 10 minutes after the beginning of class or the launch of the following module will be considered late and will be automatically reduced by 10%. Papers submitted one day after the due date will be automatically reduced by 20%; essays submitted two days after the assigned date will be reduced by 30%, etc. Exceptions will be made for extreme health and family emergencies.\n\n\n\nEach week, quizzes will be posted to Blackboard on Monday with the rest of the module. Quizzes will be graded using the scale below, and will involve 10-20 multiple choice questions. You must complete each quiz by midnight each Sunday. In the interest of fairness of assessment, I will not accept late quizzes. The quizzes will be timed; once you begin, you will have 20 minutes to complete the quiz. They will be in multiple choice format, but they will require you to apply concepts from the readings. The intent of the quizzes is to help underscore important concepts, ensure you are reading the material with some depth, and thinking through the implications of course material. The questions will vary in their degree of difficulty, so please do not be discouraged if some seem tricky. I will be dropping your lowest three quiz grades. Consider those passes to use as you wish; whether it is taking an easy week or dealing with an unexpected circumstance, you have three freebies. Note that the grading of the quizzes is also generously weighted in your favor. Again, the quizzes are to highlight key ideas or assess your grasp of some complex material, not to be punitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nJust because the quizzes go live every Monday and are due by midnight every Sunday does not mean you have to DO the quizzes at 11 pm on Sunday; you are all adults with varying levels of outside commitments and this structure allows for five weekdays/weeknights and the weekends to get the quizzes done when it is best for you.\n\n\nGrading scale:\n\nA: 4 points; all questions correct\nA-: 3.8 points; 75% or more correct\nB: 3 points; 50% or more correct\nC: 2 points; 25% or more correct\nE: 0 points; less than 25% correct\n\nYour final grade will be your point average. For instance, your average quiz grade is 3.8, you will receive an A- for the quiz portion of your class grade.\n\n\n\nMany weeks will have an assignment that serves as an illustration or application of the week‚Äôs material. The assignments are flagged in the detailed schedule and will be posted in the module of the week in which it is assigned. The group assignments will detail the requirements of the assignment. You will be assigned a group at the beginning of the semester and this will be your group for all group assignments (including any essays assigned to groups) throughout the semester. The Group Assignments are meant to help you build out, piece-by-piece, the logic and approach for applying concepts that will be used in the larger essay assignments.\n\n\n\nGroup assignments will serve as a foundation for your participation grade. Each group assignment will include a simple poll rating each group members‚Äô participation level from 1 to 10. The percent of possible points will determine your participation grade for the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nüë®‚Äçüè´:\nLecture\n\n\n‚úÖ:\nQuiz\n\n\nüë•:\nGroup Assignment\n\n\nüìÖ:\nEssay due\n\n\nüìñ:\nReading is from required text\n\n\nüìÑ:\nReading is from an article/chapter on Zotero (by author last name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nTopic\nAssignments\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n8/21\nIntro to course\n\n\n\n\n8/28\nPolicy Process\n\nüìÑ Forsythe & Boyd Memo 2 & 3\n\n\n9/5\nFoundations of Public Administration\n‚úÖ\nüìÑ Wilson  üìÑ Weber  üìÑ Kaufman\n\n\n9/11\nAccountability\n‚úÖ\nüìÑ Friedrich  üìÑ Finer  üìÑ Romzek & Dubnick\n\n\n9/18\nDecision-Making and Public Participation\n‚úÖ  üë•\nüìñ Chapter 5  üìÑ Eden & Ackerman  üìÑ Fung  üìÑ Einstein, Palmer, & Glick\n\n\n9/25\nDecision-Making in a Political Environment\n‚úÖ  üë•\nüìñ Chapter 1 & 3  üìÑ Collins\n\n\n10/2\nEquity and Fairness\n‚úÖ  üë•\nüìÑ Sandel  üìÑ Riccucci Chapter 2 & 3  üìÑ Rothstein\n\n\n10/11\nEssay 1 Assignment and Preparation\n\n\n\n\n10/16\nDirect Government: Street-level Bureaucrats\n‚úÖ  üë•\nüìÑ Lipsky  üìÑ Maynard-Moody & Musheno  üìÑ Pynes\n\n\n10/23\nGovernment by Proxy: Contracting\n‚úÖ\nüìÑ Kelman  üìÑ Brown & Potowski\n\n\n10/30\nGovernment by Proxy: Networks, Non-profits, and Delivering Services\n‚úÖ\nüìÑ Milward & Provan  üìÑ Winston  üìÑ Young\n\n\n11/6\nEssay 1 Turn In; Essay 2 Assignment and Preparation\nüë•  üìÖ\n\n\n\n11/13\nWorking Across Governments\n‚úÖ  üë•\nüìÑ Krane, Ebdon & Bartle  üìÑ Wise  üìÑ Weissert, Pollack, & Nathan\n\n\n11/20\nThanksgiving Break\n\n\n\n\n11/27\nFinal Review & Essay 2 Meetings with Groups\n\n\n\n\n12/11\nEssay 2 Turn In\nüìÖ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\nAfter the first week, readings for each week should be completed by the Tuesday of that week (that is, BEFORE CLASS!). While much of the class reading comes from the text, I will cover other material in my lectures. You will be responsible for knowing this material too!\nA large body of well-designed research has demonstrated the detrimental effects of laptops on learning in a lecture/discussion based environment. Please be courteous and do not use your computers for anything other than class related work (taking notes and so on). Cellular phones are not to be used during class time!\nLetters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\nAttend/participate in class! Again, class participation is 10% of your grade, and you can‚Äôt participate if you‚Äôre not in class or watching the class videos. If you DO need to miss class (emergencies, sickness, etc.), please contact me as soon as possible and let me know. It will be your responsibility to notify me and to get any notes/materials from other students.\nCell phones: we all have them, and they can be quite distracting. I ask that you please be courteous and silence your cell phone and leave it out of sight (in a pocket/purse/bag) during class.\nFeel free to eat and drink in class. I only ask that you do so quietly and in a manner that does not disrupt class.\nAll assignments and non-textbook readings will be posted to the class Zotero Library. I will email any announcements or updates to the class and also post them in the Blackboard. Report any trouble accessing anything on the Blackboard as soon as you encounter the problem.\nI have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\nHAVE FUN! Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\nThe table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\nStudents with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThroughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n\n\nTable.

Each assignment is weighted by the proportion of the final grade made up by the assignment itself, as described above.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty is something your professor takes very seriously. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies, visit the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT and Other LLMs\n\n\n\nBy now, we are all aware of the technological advances in generative large language models (LLMs) trained on large quantities of written language scraped from around the internet. The University policy considers the use of ChatGPT and other generative LLMs to produce classwork without explicit permission from the instructor an act of plagiarism. I do not permit the use of ChatGPT or other generative LLMs in this course. First, generative LLMs can at times invent fictional sources, recombine information that is confidently stated but ultimately incorrect, and can produce generally mediocre and formulaic writing. Such events make the output unreliable - particularly for people aiming to be professionals working in the institutions that govern our society. Second, and more importantly, grappling with complicated trade-offs, collecting and synthesizing complex information thoughtfully, and going through the process of articulating your decisions and the knowledge base that inform them is a large part of an effective professional career. Learning in general is an arduous process that involves practice, trial and error, and confronting your current limits before finding ways to overcome them. In short, learning is work and the process by which that work occurs is often reading and writing, poorly at first and much better over time. I do think that, properly understood, LLMs can be a useful tool in managing routine tasks in which you have mastered the background, can detect and correct errors, and can use such tools effectively. However, early in your careers and in your academic lives, the very purpose of being in a graduate program is to have opportunities to learn new things (or old things in new ways) and using an LLM to do the work involved in learning will only cheat you of opportunities to learn, grow, and develop deeper and more lasting skills. Finally, and more practically, if you are caught using LLMs to produce the work assigned in this class, the work will be given a 0 and you will be cited for plagiarism.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students. This includes students with physical, sensory, medical, cognitive, learning, mental health, and other disabilities. If you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services (DAISS) by emailing daiss@albany.edu or calling 518 -442-5501. DAISS staff will explain the documentation and registration process, and set you up with an appointment. Once you have completed registration, you will be provided with a letter to inform your instructors that you are a student with a disability registered with DAISS, and which lists the recommended reasonable accommodations for your courses.\n\n\n\nThe Counseling Center (518-442-5800; 400 Patroon Creek Blvd, Suite 104) offers counseling and consultations regarding personal concerns, self-help information, and connections to off-campus resources. More information can be found at their site.\n\n\n\nSUNY-Albany offers a great collection available in several different media. Access to research help and library tutorials can be found online at the library‚Äôs site.\nFor information about SUNY-Albany‚Äôs Dewey Graduate Library, which is located on the Downtown Campus, visit their site.\n\n\n\nThe university offers a number of services for students who need assistance with writing and research projects. Support is available in the Writing Center (518-442-4061; 140 HU) and at the University Library. Information about the Writing Center can be found at their site.\n\n\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies prohibit offenses defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), sexual exploitation, and stalking. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies apply to the entire University at Albany community, including students, faculty, and staff of all gender identities. The University at Albany provides a variety of resources for support and advocacy to assist individuals who have experienced sexual offenses.\nConfidential support and guidance can be found through the Counseling Center (518-442-5800, or online), the University Health Center (518-442-5454, or online), and the Interfaith Center (518-489-8573, or online). Individuals at these locations will not report crimes to law enforcement or university officials without permission, except for in extreme circumstances, such as a health and/or safety emergency. Additionally, the Advocates at the University at Albany‚Äôs Advocacy Center for Sexual Violence are available to assist students without sharing information that could identify them (518-442-CARE, or online).\nSexual offenses can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within The Office for Equity and Compliance (518-442-3800, or online, Building 25, Room 117) and/or the University Police Department (518-442-3131, or online).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Faculty members are considered ‚Äúresponsible employees‚Äù at the University at Albany, meaning that they are required to report all known relevant details about a complaint of sexual violence to the University‚Äôs Title IX Coordinator, including names of anyone involved or present, date, time, and location.\n\n\nIn case of an emergency, please call 911.\n\n\n\nA tentative grade given only when the student has nearly completed the course but due to circumstances beyond the student‚Äôs control the work is not completed on schedule. The date for the completion of the work is specified by the instructor. The date stipulated will not be later than one month before the end of the session following that in which the Incomplete is received. The grade I is automatically changed to E or U unless work is completed as agreed between the student and the instructor.\n\n\n\nStudents are excused, without penalty, to be absent because of religious beliefs, and will be provided equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. Students should notify the instructor of record in a timely manner, and the instructor will work directly with students to accommodate religious observances. Online courses will not schedule any assignment deadlines on religious holidays."

I strongly encourage you to meet with your groups with an early video call and get to know each other, your schedules, and so on. Communication helps dramatically in successful groups. That said, some group dynamics can - in very rare circumstances - become bad for all involved. I provide two means for coping: first, students can use peer evaluations to ensure accountability in group work. And second, if that is insufficient, the group can vote to remove a member and inform me of the decision. No harm, no foul. This should be considered a measure of last resort and only pursued if a group member has made no contributions to the group."

    "text": "The following assignments will form the basis of your grade in this course:\n\nTwo essays (70% of final grade)\nWeekly quizzes (15% of final grade)\nGroup assignments (10% of final grade)\nParticipation (5% of final grade)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll assignments will be turned in via Brightspace.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo assess your understanding of the course material and your ability to apply concepts to real life cases of government action, students will write three essays during the semester. The essays will require students to conduct independent research and analysis. Additional details about the exact questions and formatting will be distributed separately. Together, the essays constitute 70% of the student‚Äôs grade for the course. The essays will be graded using the rubric outlined in the Appendix. Each essay will be weighted equally, and the average grade across both essays will determine your grade for the essay portion of your final grade. For instance, if your average grade across both essays is an 89, you will receive an 89 for the essay portion of your final grade.\nPre-writing tasks. To improve the quality of the essays, you may submit for feedback a one page summary of the major arguments of your essay one week before each essay is due. I will not accept late submissions of summaries. I will return the summaries 2 to 3 days after submission.\nAcceptable sources. Generally, your research should use primary sources more than secondary sources. Primary sources include, but are not limited to: government reports, legislative hearings and testimonies, court decisions, and government auditor reports. Secondary sources are summaries and interpretations of primary sources. Secondary sources include, but are not limited to, articles from major newspapers and news magazines, network and cable news programs, and academic research. Blogs and Wikipedia are not acceptable sources. Be an intelligent consumer of information by evaluating secondary sources for potential political bias. If it is well known that a particular source is liberal or conservative, you must compensate for this in the paper. Acknowledge its bias and balance the information with something from a source on the other side of the political spectrum. Here are some places to start with your research, but feel free to consult other sources:\n\nAcademic research published in public administration, political science, economics, or policy journals such as: Public Administration Review, Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, American Review of Public Administration, Administration and Society, Journal of Public Policy Analysis and Management, American Political Science Review, American Journal of Political Science, and Journal of Politics, American Economic Review, Journal of Labor Economics, Policy Studies Journal.\nCongressional testimony (available through Lexis/Nexis via the library) and reports completed by Congressional committee staff\nAgency Inspector General reports\nCongressional Research Service reports\nU.S. Government Accountability Office reports\nThe library also has research support services for this class, which can be found here\n\nSubmission of papers. Each final essay is due by midnight on the designated due date. Electronic versions of the paper are to be submitted via the SafeAssign link in Blackboard. It is the student‚Äôs responsibility to ensure the electronic file is readable and not corrupted. Please note: once you hit the submit button in SafeAssign, you cannot go back and submit a different version.\nLate assignments. An assignment is considered late if the paper copy is not submitted at the beginning of class, if the electronic file is not submitted before class, and/or if the electronic file is not readable. Assignments (electronic or hard copy) submitted 10 minutes after the beginning of class or the launch of the following module will be considered late and will be automatically reduced by 10%. Papers submitted one day after the due date will be automatically reduced by 20%; essays submitted two days after the assigned date will be reduced by 30%, etc. Exceptions will be made for extreme health and family emergencies.\n\n\n\nEach week, quizzes will be posted to Blackboard on Monday with the rest of the module. Quizzes will be graded using the scale below, and will involve 10-20 multiple choice questions. You must complete each quiz by midnight each Sunday. In the interest of fairness of assessment, I will not accept late quizzes. The quizzes will be timed; once you begin, you will have 20 minutes to complete the quiz. They will be in multiple choice format, but they will require you to apply concepts from the readings. The intent of the quizzes is to help underscore important concepts, ensure you are reading the material with some depth, and thinking through the implications of course material. The questions will vary in their degree of difficulty, so please do not be discouraged if some seem tricky. I will be dropping your lowest three quiz grades. Consider those passes to use as you wish; whether it is taking an easy week or dealing with an unexpected circumstance, you have three freebies. Note that the grading of the quizzes is also generously weighted in your favor. Again, the quizzes are to highlight key ideas or assess your grasp of some complex material, not to be punitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nJust because the quizzes go live every Monday and are due by midnight every Sunday does not mean you have to DO the quizzes at 11 pm on Sunday; you are all adults with varying levels of outside commitments and this structure allows for five weekdays/weeknights and the weekends to get the quizzes done when it is best for you.\n\n\nGrading scale:\n\nA: 4 points; all questions correct\nA-: 3.8 points; 75% or more correct\nB: 3 points; 50% or more correct\nC: 2 points; 25% or more correct\nE: 0 points; less than 25% correct\n\nYour final grade will be your point average. For instance, your average quiz grade is 3.8, you will receive an A- for the quiz portion of your class grade.\n\n\n\nMany weeks will have an assignment that serves as an illustration or application of the week‚Äôs material. The assignments are flagged in the detailed schedule and will be posted in the module of the week in which it is assigned. The group assignments will detail the requirements of the assignment. You will be assigned a group at the beginning of the semester and this will be your group for all group assignments (including any essays assigned to groups) throughout the semester. The Group Assignments are meant to help you build out, piece-by-piece, the logic and approach for applying concepts that will be used in the larger essay assignments.\n\n\n\nGroup assignments will serve as a foundation for your participation grade. Each group assignment will include a simple poll rating each group members‚Äô participation level from 1 to 10. The percent of possible points will determine your participation grade for the class."

    "text": "Public policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\nAfter the first week, readings for each week should be completed by the Tuesday of that week (that is, BEFORE CLASS!). While much of the class reading comes from the text, I will cover other material in my lectures. You will be responsible for knowing this material too!\nA large body of well-designed research has demonstrated the detrimental effects of laptops on learning in a lecture/discussion based environment. Please be courteous and do not use your computers for anything other than class related work (taking notes and so on). Cellular phones are not to be used during class time!\nLetters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\nAttend/participate in class! Again, class participation is 10% of your grade, and you can‚Äôt participate if you‚Äôre not in class or watching the class videos. If you DO need to miss class (emergencies, sickness, etc.), please contact me as soon as possible and let me know. It will be your responsibility to notify me and to get any notes/materials from other students.\nCell phones: we all have them, and they can be quite distracting. I ask that you please be courteous and silence your cell phone and leave it out of sight (in a pocket/purse/bag) during class.\nFeel free to eat and drink in class. I only ask that you do so quietly and in a manner that does not disrupt class.\nAll assignments and non-textbook readings will be posted to the class Zotero Library. I will email any announcements or updates to the class and also post them in the Blackboard. Report any trouble accessing anything on the Blackboard as soon as you encounter the problem.\nI have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\nHAVE FUN! Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\nThe table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\nStudents with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThroughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n\n\nTable.

Each assignment is weighted by the proportion of the final grade made up by the assignment itself, as described above.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty is something your professor takes very seriously. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies, visit the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT and Other LLMs\n\n\n\nBy now, we are all aware of the technological advances in generative large language models (LLMs) trained on large quantities of written language scraped from around the internet. The University policy considers the use of ChatGPT and other generative LLMs to produce classwork without explicit permission from the instructor an act of plagiarism. I do not permit the use of ChatGPT or other generative LLMs in this course. First, generative LLMs can at times invent fictional sources, recombine information that is confidently stated but ultimately incorrect, and can produce generally mediocre and formulaic writing. Such events make the output unreliable - particularly for people aiming to be professionals working in the institutions that govern our society. Second, and more importantly, grappling with complicated trade-offs, collecting and synthesizing complex information thoughtfully, and going through the process of articulating your decisions and the knowledge base that inform them is a large part of an effective professional career. Learning in general is an arduous process that involves practice, trial and error, and confronting your current limits before finding ways to overcome them. In short, learning is work and the process by which that work occurs is often reading and writing, poorly at first and much better over time. I do think that, properly understood, LLMs can be a useful tool in managing routine tasks in which you have mastered the background, can detect and correct errors, and can use such tools effectively. However, early in your careers and in your academic lives, the very purpose of being in a graduate program is to have opportunities to learn new things (or old things in new ways) and using an LLM to do the work involved in learning will only cheat you of opportunities to learn, grow, and develop deeper and more lasting skills. Finally, and more practically, if you are caught using LLMs to produce the work assigned in this class, the work will be given a 0 and you will be cited for plagiarism.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students. This includes students with physical, sensory, medical, cognitive, learning, mental health, and other disabilities. If you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services (DAISS) by emailing daiss@albany.edu or calling 518 -442-5501. DAISS staff will explain the documentation and registration process, and set you up with an appointment. Once you have completed registration, you will be provided with a letter to inform your instructors that you are a student with a disability registered with DAISS, and which lists the recommended reasonable accommodations for your courses.\n\n\n\nThe Counseling Center (518-442-5800; 400 Patroon Creek Blvd, Suite 104) offers counseling and consultations regarding personal concerns, self-help information, and connections to off-campus resources. More information can be found at their site.\n\n\n\nSUNY-Albany offers a great collection available in several different media. Access to research help and library tutorials can be found online at the library‚Äôs site.\nFor information about SUNY-Albany‚Äôs Dewey Graduate Library, which is located on the Downtown Campus, visit their site.\n\n\n\nThe university offers a number of services for students who need assistance with writing and research projects. Support is available in the Writing Center (518-442-4061; 140 HU) and at the University Library. Information about the Writing Center can be found at their site.\n\n\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies prohibit offenses defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), sexual exploitation, and stalking. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies apply to the entire University at Albany community, including students, faculty, and staff of all gender identities. The University at Albany provides a variety of resources for support and advocacy to assist individuals who have experienced sexual offenses.\nConfidential support and guidance can be found through the Counseling Center (518-442-5800, or online), the University Health Center (518-442-5454, or online), and the Interfaith Center (518-489-8573, or online). Individuals at these locations will not report crimes to law enforcement or university officials without permission, except for in extreme circumstances, such as a health and/or safety emergency. Additionally, the Advocates at the University at Albany‚Äôs Advocacy Center for Sexual Violence are available to assist students without sharing information that could identify them (518-442-CARE, or online).\nSexual offenses can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within The Office for Equity and Compliance (518-442-3800, or online, Building 25, Room 117) and/or the University Police Department (518-442-3131, or online).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Faculty members are considered ‚Äúresponsible employees‚Äù at the University at Albany, meaning that they are required to report all known relevant details about a complaint of sexual violence to the University‚Äôs Title IX Coordinator, including names of anyone involved or present, date, time, and location.\n\n\nIn case of an emergency, please call 911.\n\n\n\nA tentative grade given only when the student has nearly completed the course but due to circumstances beyond the student‚Äôs control the work is not completed on schedule. The date for the completion of the work is specified by the instructor. The date stipulated will not be later than one month before the end of the session following that in which the Incomplete is received. The grade I is automatically changed to E or U unless work is completed as agreed between the student and the instructor.\n\n\n\nStudents are excused, without penalty, to be absent because of religious beliefs, and will be provided equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. Students should notify the instructor of record in a timely manner, and the instructor will work directly with students to accommodate religious observances. Online courses will not schedule any assignment deadlines on religious holidays."

First, they will provide groups with a role in a scenario that facilitates the application of concepts from the modules to a more concrete example. The assignments will generally take place in a fictional city, Hopetopia, which is loosely based on real cities and the parameters and characteristics of which will be provided as relevant to each activity. Second, many of the skills targeted by the assignments are trial runs for working with concepts that will be explored in more depth in essays 1 and 2 later in the course. Generally, applications grounded in a hypothetical situation similar to real-world events provides opportunities for more enjoyable and interesting discussion. It also provides an early, low-stakes context to get to know your group mates and their work styles. All group assignments should be grounded in the city of Hopetopia using the information on its website (linked above) as well as research on any proposed programs/policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip on Groups\n\n\n\nIn many group assignments, you will be asked to write a 1- or 2-page memo to respond to the prompt. Building a good memo packs a lot of information succinctly into a short document. Use the data and information about Hopetopia to creatively build your case in the memo alongside in-depth research about related problems and evidence for the solution you are proposing (see the acceptable sources section on the syllabus for some source ideas."

    "text": "For assignment 1, 7 groups will be representing different Hopetopia city government departments and 1 group will be representing the executive branch of the city government (the mayor‚Äôs office). Fortunately, the city finds itself with a 5% budgetary surplus entering FY23 due to an uptick in economic growth in Hopetopia. The assignment will unfold in three stages:\n\n\nThe group representing the mayor‚Äôs office (see the table below) will kick things off. As you will see on the City of Hopetopia website, the city operates five city agencies - each with two departments - and the Mayor‚Äôs office (you) are currently preparing your FY23 budget. Write and post a 1-page (MAXIMUM) memo to the discussion board that outlines the distribution of new funding across each agency (i.e., the total amount of money each agency may add to its budget). In the memo, the mayor‚Äôs office should offer a clear rationale for the distribution of funds and any general priorities that agencies should consider when making cuts. Of course, the mayor does not want to run afoul of voters, so the mayor‚Äôs office wants a plan from the agencies on how they will spend the dollars allocated to the agency. The memo outlining the plan for the budget is due by midnight on Wednesday, 9/20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe mayor‚Äôs office should post this as a new thread with the title ‚ÄúBudget Changes Memo‚Äù in the forum ‚ÄúHopetopia - Assignment 1 Forum.‚Äù To ensure you follow the length limits and ease coordinating with groupmates, I suggest using Google Docs to write the memo and one person from the group can simply copy and paste it into the body of the thread when you are done. Be sure the post includes the names of all group members. You can either copy and paste a table with the new budget or include bullets with each agency‚Äôs allocation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip on Mayor‚Äôs Office\n\n\n\nThe Mayor‚Äôs office should think of themselves as stearing a mid-sized ship. This is a big city with a government proportionate to its size and complexity - the mayor cannot afford to be watching every line item. That‚Äôs why they appoint agency heads they trust! A way to approach this is to take some time to get to know the city and its agencies, then decide - as a group - on your priorities. From there, in a Google Sheets or the Google Doc where you draft your memo, allocate the dollars available as desired across departments. Use last year‚Äôs budget as a guidepost and distribute increases and decreases from there.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach agency should respond to the mayor‚Äôs memo with a plan that:\n\nExamines the overall agency allocation and prepare a budget proposal that makes use of the available funds.\nIdentifies 3 stakeholders the agency will engage to gauge priorities among key stakeholders.\nOutline a process for getting information from stakeholders regarding priorities. Include details like a timeline for public engagement, number of meetings with different stakeholders, schedule of meetings, and any deliverables you expect from engagement.\n\nThe agency should include a brief rationale for the stakeholders included and the approach taken for engagement and gauging priorities. The response should be no longer than a single page. The stakeholder engagement plan is due by midnight on Sunday, 9/24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou will notice that most of your departments will be splitting a pool of funds allocated to your agency by the mayor‚Äôs office. In addition to preparing your overall budget request, you should make the case for how much of the overall pool of new funds (or cuts) coming to the agency your department should receive and what you would plan to do with the funds (or cuts) (and the affected stakeholders) in your budget proposal memo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse some creativity when thinking about the city of Hopetopia and the kinds of stakeholders likely to be operating in a city of that size and type. I have provided some details that you may draw on, but you should also be a little creative. I suggest using a Google Doc to draft your one page memo together and then copying and pasting the memo as a reply to the Mayor‚Äôs Budget Changes Memo in the Hopetopia Assignment 1 forum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nRole\n\n\n\n\nGroup 1\nMayor\n\n\nGroup 2\nPolice Department\n\n\nGroup 3\nFire Department\n\n\nGroup 4\nHousing and Planning Agency\n\n\nGroup 5\nBuildings and Regulations\n\n\nGroup 6\nAdult Human Services\n\n\nGroup 7\nYouth Social Services\n\n\nGroup 8\nTransportation Department"

You can either copy and paste a table with the new budget or include bullets with each agency‚Äôs allocation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip on Mayor‚Äôs Office\n\n\n\nThe Mayor‚Äôs office should think of themselves as stearing a mid-sized ship. This is a big city with a government proportionate to its size and complexity - the mayor cannot afford to be watching every line item. That‚Äôs why they appoint agency heads they trust! A way to approach this is to take some time to get to know the city and its agencies, then decide - as a group - on your priorities. From there, in a Google Sheets or the Google Doc where you draft your memo, allocate the dollars available as desired across departments. Use last year‚Äôs budget as a guidepost and distribute increases and decreases from there.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach agency should respond to the mayor‚Äôs memo with a plan that:\n\nExamines the overall agency allocation and prepare a budget proposal that makes use of the available funds.\nIdentifies 3 stakeholders the agency will engage to gauge priorities among key stakeholders.\nOutline a process for getting information from stakeholders regarding priorities. Include details like a timeline for public engagement, number of meetings with different stakeholders, schedule of meetings, and any deliverables you expect from engagement.\n\nThe agency should include a brief rationale for the stakeholders included and the approach taken for engagement and gauging priorities. The response should be no longer than a single page. The stakeholder engagement plan is due by midnight on Sunday, 9/24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou will notice that most of your departments will be splitting a pool of funds allocated to your agency by the mayor‚Äôs office. In addition to preparing your overall budget request, you should make the case for how much of the overall pool of new funds (or cuts) coming to the agency your department should receive and what you would plan to do with the funds (or cuts) (and the affected stakeholders) in your budget proposal memo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse some creativity when thinking about the city of Hopetopia and the kinds of stakeholders likely to be operating in a city of that size and type. I have provided some details that you may draw on, but you should also be a little creative. I suggest using a Google Doc to draft your one page memo together and then copying and pasting the memo as a reply to the Mayor‚Äôs Budget Changes Memo in the Hopetopia Assignment 1 forum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nRole\n\n\n\n\nGroup 1\nMayor\n\n\nGroup 2\nPolice Department\n\n\nGroup 3\nFire Department\n\n\nGroup 4\nHousing and Planning Agency\n\n\nGroup 5\nBuildings and Regulations\n\n\nGroup 6\nAdult Human Services\n\n\nGroup 7\nYouth Social Services\n\n\nGroup 8\nTransportation Department"

    "text": "For assignment 2, we return to Hopetopia. All 10 groups will be representing different Hopetopia city government agencies. The assignment this time is straight forward. Each group will prepare: 1) a mission statement of no more than four sentences that captures the mission and vision of their programs; 2) a performance indicator for 3 programs; and 3) how frequently data on the performance indicator will be collected, how it will be collected and stored, and any staff that will be allocated to tracking the information (can be a full-time position, a part-time position, multiple positions, or a percentage of time of a staff with other duties). As with assignment 1, you will be writing a 1-2 page memo as a group and posting it in the Hopetopia Forum as a reply to the ‚ÄúAssignment 2 Thread‚Äù I have created. The memo for assignment 2 is due by midnight on Sunday, October 2nd.\nThe Mayor‚Äôs priorities (from assignment 1) has been added to this assignment and the budget for each agency has been updated to reflect the mayor‚Äôs budget guidance.\n\nGroup Assignments\n\n\n\nGroup\nRole\n\n\n\n\nGroup 4\nPolice Department\n\n\nGroup 6\nFire Department\n\n\nGroup 5\nHousing and Planning Agency\n\n\nGroup 1\nBuildings and Regulations\n\n\nGroup 7\nAdult Human Services\n\n\nGroup 2\nYouth Social Services\n\n\nGroup 3\nTransportation Department\n\n\nGroup 8\nGeneral Services Department\n\n\n\n\n\nMayor‚Äôs Budget Memo\nCurrent Budget: $5,031,509,700.00\nDepartment of Emergency Services\n\nAllocation: $1,229,355,000\nRationale: Emergency Services has adequately served all four wards in Hopetopia and received 26% of the 2032 FY budget. The Mayor‚Äôs Office will reassess funding increases for FY 2024.\n\nDepartment of Community Development\n\nAllocation: $241,181,280\nRationale: Due to a lack of business development, inequitable food access, and a growing amount of inadequate housing infrastructure in the Southwest Ward, the Mayor‚Äôs Office has chosen to allocate a 3% increase in the FY23 budget to the Department of Community Development. By prioritizing community development, it is our goal to create more structure and unity for everyone.\n\nDepartment of Social Services\n\nAllocation: $608,625,140\nRationale: The betterment of a community will never be achieved without help. Due to the local supermarket closing and businesses shutting down, an increase in funding will allow the provision of expanded services. Social services can support the community with food insecurity through issuing EBT/ SNAP benefits, which will help alleviate some of the financial burden with groceries. The Mayor‚Äôs Office has decided to give Social Service a 1% increase because they will help the betterment of the community, in terms of short-term goals.\n\nDepartment of General Services\n\nAllocation: $974,510,280\nRationale: Community development is impossible without adequate transportation for all citizens in all wards of Hopetopia on safely maintained roads, bridges, and sidewalks. We have chosen to allocate a 2% increase to General Services to ensure transportation to grocery stores, social services offices, and for the maintenance of all roads in Hopetopia.\n\nDepartment of Education\n\nAllocation: $1,977,838,000\nRationale: The Department of Education was allocated over 40% of the FY22 budget. This will be maintained for FY 23 as we want to use the surplus to address more dire needs such as food, housing, and vocational insecurities. We hope to increase economic equity throughout the wards through helping to meet more immediate needs of its citizens."

    "text": "For assignment 3, we return to Hopetopia with new information about what each agency is prioritizing, how they are measuring performance, and what their workforces currently look like. All 10 groups will be representing different Hopetopia city government agencies. In order to tackle diversity and equity issues in the city, each agency will receive 1,500,000 additional dollars from the mayor‚Äôs office. The agency can use the money to target either workforce diversity issues OR issues regarding equity in services. By midnight on Sunday, October 8th, each group will prepare a one page memo that outlines: 1) whether they will focus on equity or diversity and why; 2) how they will use the money to tackle the issue they chose; and 3) any limitations in the performance indicators they have available for deciding on 1 and 2 and what additional performance indicators would have made the decision easier. As with previous assignments, you will be writing a 1-2 page memo as a group and posting it in the Hopetopia Forum as a reply to the ‚ÄúAssignment 3 Thread‚Äù I have created. Be sure your post includes the names of all group members.\nThe Mayor‚Äôs priorities (from assignment 1) has been added to this assignment and the budget for each agency has been updated to reflect the mayor‚Äôs budget guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip on Creative Use of Information\n\n\n\nYou can use percentages of different groups in the city to get a sense of the total population a program intends to serve and the percentage of cases in a performance indicator to get a sense for how many cases are failing or succeeding in a certain ward. For instance, table 1 in the economic statistics on Hopetopia shows that 18 percent of Northwest Hopetopia lives under the poverty line. 0.18 x 179,271 equals about 32,268 people living in poverty in Northwest. If a program aiming to help low-income Hopetopians only is only enrolling 45% of eligible Hopetopians, 0.45 x 32,268 tells us that the program is reaching 14,520 people. You can use these sorts of simple calculations to get a sense for staffing needs, scale of performance wins and areas for improvement, and a variety of other creative ways to assess and tackle problems in Hopetopia.\n\n\n\nMayor‚Äôs Budget Memo\nCurrent Budget: $5,031,509,700.00\nDepartment of Emergency Services\n\nAllocation: $1,229,355,000\nRationale: Emergency Services has adequately served all four wards in Hopetopia and received 26% of the 2032 FY budget.
